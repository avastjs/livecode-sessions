Live Coding Sessions

It is just a simple desk app which puts 3 apps together (code, audio, draw) in a responsiveness way, so you can have all at once, great for sharing sessions since you share just a CODE and they use this to get all other accesses.

#### You can use this as you wish, but here there are some common use cases:

- Mentor who needs to share a live code session with the audience.
- Teacher who wants to share and interact with students.
- Pair programming / Mob programming sessions (give edit permissions on codesandbox).
